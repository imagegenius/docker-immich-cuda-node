[immich-cuda-node](https://github.com/imagegenius/docker-immich-cuda-node) is a remote machine leaning worker for Immich

## Supported Architectures

We use Docker manifest for cross-platform compatibility. More details can be found on [Docker's website](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list).

To obtain the appropriate image for your architecture, simply pull `ghcr.io/imagegenius/immich-cuda-node:latest`. Alternatively, you can also obtain specific architecture images by using tags.

This image supports the following architectures:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ❌ | |
| armhf | ❌ | |

## Application Setup

To start, you will need to modify your Immich instance by disabling its built-in machine learning service.

On your main Immich container, set the necessary environment variables:

- Set `CUDA_ACCELERATION` to `false`. This will disable CUDA acceleration.
- Set `IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL` to `http://<ip>:3003`.

`/photos` volume path containing your Immich assets must be reachable by the worker.

Replace `<ip>` with the IP address of your immich-cuda-node container/host.

## Enabling GPU Acceleration with this container

To start this image with GPU support, you need to modify your Docker settings.

If you're using the Docker CLI, add the `--gpus=all` flag to your command.

```sh
docker run --gpus=all ...
```

If you're using Docker Compose, add the following under your service:

```yaml
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

This will reserve all available GPUs for your container, using the NVIDIA driver.

## Usage

Example snippets to start creating a container:

### Docker Compose

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  immich-cuda-node:
    image: ghcr.io/imagegenius/immich-cuda-node:latest
    container_name: immich-cuda-node
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - path_to_appdata:/config
      - path_to_photos:/photos
    ports:
      - 3003:3003
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Docker CLI ([Click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=immich-cuda-node \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -p 3003:3003 \
  -v path_to_appdata:/config \
  -v path_to_photos:/photos \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/imagegenius/immich-cuda-node:latest

```

## Variables

To configure the container, pass variables at runtime using the format `<external>:<internal>`. For instance, `-p 8080:80` exposes port `80` inside the container, making it accessible outside the container via the host's IP on port `8080`.

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 3003` | WebUI Port |
| `-e PUID=1000` | UID for permissions - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | GID for permissions - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Etc/UTC` | Specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |
| `-v /config` | Package cache, this folder could potentially use +5GB! |
| `-v /photos` | Contains all the photos uploaded to Immich |

## Umask for running applications

All of our images allow overriding the default umask setting for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 option. Note that umask works differently than chmod and subtracts permissions based on its value, not adding. For more information, please refer to the Wikipedia article on umask [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask).

## User / Group Identifiers

To avoid permissions issues when using volumes (`-v` flags) between the host OS and the container, you can specify the user (`PUID`) and group (`PGID`). Make sure that the volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify, and the issues will disappear.

Example: `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`. To find your PUID and PGID, run `id user`.

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Updating the Container

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app. We do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Check the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section for recommendations for the specific image.

Instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull immich-cuda-node`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d immich-cuda-node`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/imagegenius/immich-cuda-node:latest`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop immich-cuda-node`
* Delete the container: `docker rm immich-cuda-node`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

## Versions

* **25.05.23:** - Initial Release.
